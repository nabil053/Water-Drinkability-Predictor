# Water-Drinkability-Predictor

A simple logistic regression model that predicts whether the sample water is drinkable or not based on a set of attributes.

The dataset used here is called water_potability.csv and it includes descriptions of various chemical properties of water samples. The dataset has 
a total of 9 attributes (class excluded), which are pH values, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfates, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes
and turbidity.

The dataset used here contains a total of 8124 sample data, which has been split into training data (5686, 70%) for training the model and testing data (2438, 30%) for testing the model's metrics.

The file 'Decision Tree.jpg' included in this repository shows the structure of the decision tree.

The generated model has the ability to predict a sample mushroom's edibility with an accuracy of 99.95%, and its precision and recall are 100% and 99.92% respectively.
